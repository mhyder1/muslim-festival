            <p>
              Aside from Muslims celebrating Eid within their respective areas,
              the NCMF is an opportunity to unite Muslims within North Carolina
              to celebrate diversity. NCMF embraces unity while learning about
              various cultures and allowing non-Muslims to meet their Muslim
              neighbors.

              The NCMF is a city-permitted event. Therefore, all vendors selling
              unpackaged food must be approved by the local and state Food and
              Health departments.

                Self-Help Information Network and Exchange (SHINE) is a 501(c)3
                registered non-profit organization established within the United
                States. The NCMF is one of its major community events that
                promote cultural understanding, community engagement, diversity,
                humanity, arts, and unity.
              </p>

          content={
            <p>
              The NCMF is held in Greensboro because it is centrally located in
              NC as well as centrally located between two larger cities â€“
              Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham (1 hour drive time), which makes
              travel easier for those living outside of the Piedmont-Triad area.
              Additionally, the founders of NCMF reside in the Greensboro area.

              While the word Muslim is in the title of the event, the event is
              open to the public. People who identify as other faiths are
              welcome to come to learn and fellowship for the sake of cultural
              understanding, education, community engagement, diversity, and
              unity.
