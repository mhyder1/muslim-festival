        The North Carolina Muslim Festival is sponsored by the Self-Help
        Information Network and Exchange (S.H.I.N.E.). Founded by Robyn
        Saleem-Abdusamad, S.H.I.N.E. is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit
        organization that provides educational programs and interactive
        activities for the community designed to build cultural understanding
        and unity while empowering through education, faith, service, and
        humanity.

        On April 29, 2023, S.H.I.N.E. successfully hosted the first annual NC
        Muslim Festival in Center City Park - downtown Greensboro, NC. Over
        273,000 Muslims reside in North Carolina and something of this magnitude
        had never been done in our state. The city of Greensboro is an ideal
        location for this event as it is centrally located between two of our
        largest cities - Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham.

        The NC Muslim Festival attracted over 1,000 people statewide. The
        purpose of this event is to promote education, cultural understanding,
        unity, and humanity. We do so by helping to build bridges with community
        members and offer an opportunity for civic pride, as well as education.
        Proudly, we had over 30 vendors with products ranging from health,
        beauty, and wellness, to art, jewelry, clothing, and books. While many
        of the vendors were local business owners, there were quite a few who
        traveled from Raleigh, Durham, Charlotte, Eastern and Western North
        Carolina, and as far as Indiana to participate in the festival.
        Attendees enjoyed the educational and interactive African drumming
        circle, the games and prizes offered at the KidZone area, and music from
        a renowned hip-hop Muslim artist, Haa Seen Noon. There was a huge amount
        of diverse representation that filled the park along with peaceful,
        loving vibes from all.

        Each year, we hope for the festival to continue to grow and become a
        beacon for the communities to celebrate diversity and embrace unity.
